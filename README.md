 Canned ACLs:

  The following canned ACLs are supported:
    private (default), public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read

 ACL Format:

  For the getacl and setacl commands, the format of the ACL list is JSON :
  1) The value of "Owner" must be Owner ID or one of :GRPS0000000CANONICAL, GRPS000000ANONYMOUSE.
  	 The GRPS0000000CANONICAL means CANONICA group, GRPS000000ANONYMOUSE means ANONYMOUSE group.
  2) The format of "ACL" muset be a map. Key is Owner ID, value is Permission set.
  3) The Permission is one of: READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, or WRITE_ACP.

  Examples:
     {
	      "ACL": {
		          "SINA000000xxxxxx": [
		              "read",
		              "write",
		              "read_acp",
		              "write_acp"
		          ],
		          "SINA000000xxxxxx": [
		              "read",
		              "read_acp"
		          ]
		  }
	  }

  Note that the easiest way to modify an ACL is to first get it, saving it
  into a file, then modifying the file, and then setting the modified file
  back as the new ACL for the bucket/object.

 Date Format:

  The format for dates used in parameters is as ISO 8601 dates, i.e.
  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[+/-dd:dd].  Examples:
      2008-07-29T20:36:14Z
